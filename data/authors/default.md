Alex Paschal is a high school student dual-enrolled in a university where he takes college-level math courses.

他在隔离期间学了一点中文. Il espère également apprendre le français à l'avenir.

Besides foreign language, he, a Reformed Baptist, is interested in Christianity, its theology and apologetics, its split at the Protestant Reformation, and philosophy.

Finally, his afore alluded to interest in mathematics—the field he plans to go into—has led him to write a few rudimentary math papers that can be found [here](https://index.baguetteboy.com/math).
